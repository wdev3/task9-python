# 📦 Data Structures — Queues (Manual Implementation)

This project is a practice of **Queue (FIFO)** logic using Python.  
The queue works with **First In, First Out** — the first item added is the first one removed.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Add items to the queue
- Remove items from the queue
- Separated queues for:
  - Numbers
  - Tasks
  - Names
  - Letters
  - Objects

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand how queue logic works (FIFO)
- Manual implementation of enqueue and dequeue operations
- Practice with classes, methods, and list operations in Python
- Strengthen understanding of basic data structures

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the `.py` file using Python 3
3. Check the terminal for the queue operations output
